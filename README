The SocialPlate application is an android application being developed by 4 Milwaukee School of Engineering Student for SE-4910: Mobile Application Development.  The main purpose of the application is to experiment with social networking integration into an application, and secondarily to see how the existing functionality provided by an application like UrbanSpoon can be extended by a third party in a fairly limited timeframe (i.e. 3 weeks).
